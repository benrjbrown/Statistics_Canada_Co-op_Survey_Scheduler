# Statistics_Canada_Co-op_Survey_Scheduler
This project is the result of an assignment given to a co-worker and I during my co-op job at Statistics Canada in summer 2020.
The aim of this project was to develop a visualization that pulled survey schedule dates from Statistics Canada's cloud system to more efficiently schedule future surveys. This included loading in and cleaning an Excel file which described which surveys depended on which other surveys in order to be delivered, a novel challenge to me at the time.
