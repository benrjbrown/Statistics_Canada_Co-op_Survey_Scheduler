# Statistics_Canada_Co-op_Survey_Scheduler
This project is the result of an assignment given to a co-worker and I during my co-op job at Statistics Canada in summer 2020.
The aim of this project was to develop a visualizatio that pulled dates from Statistics Canada's cloud system on survey scheduling in order to more efficiently schedule future surveys.
